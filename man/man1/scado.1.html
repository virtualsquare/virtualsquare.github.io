<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B><A HREF="../man1/cado.1.html">cado</A>(1)</B> allows the system administrator to delegate capabilities to users.
Users can grant a subset of these ambient capabilities to trusted programs.
Each user can define their own list of trusted programs and which capabilities to grant, using a scado file.
<B>cado -S</B> or <B>cado --scado</B> run those trusted programs without any further authentication.
In this way it is also possible to run programs requiring specific capabilities within a bash script.
<P>
<B>Scado</B> is the command a user can run to create, edit, check or delete their own scado file.
<P>
Each line of a scado file file has the following syntax:
<BR>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>path_of_the_executable_file : capability_list</I>

</DL>

<BR>

or
<BR>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>path_of_the_executable_file : capability_list : sha256_digest_of_the_executable</I>

</DL>

<BR>

(See the EXAMPLES section at the end of the man page for more info. All the trailing part of a line following a # sign is a comment.).
<P>
The <I>path_of_the_executable_file</I> must be absolute.
<P>
The <I>capability_list</I> is a comma separated list of capability names or capability
masks.  For brevity, the <B>cap_</B> prefix of capabilities names can be omitted
(e.g. <B>net_admin</B> and <B>cap_net_admin</B> have the same meaning).
<P>
The <I>sha256_digest_of_the_executable</I> prevents <I>TOCTTOU</I> attacks. When a user
wants to run the file at <I>path_of_the_executable_file</I> granting it some of
the capabilities in the <I>capability_list</I>, the permission is denied if
its sha256 digest does not match <I>sha256_digest_of_the_executable</I>.
<P>
If there are only two colon (<B>:</B>) separated fields in a line, it means that
the user trusts a priori the integrity of the file whose pathname is <I>path_of_the_executable_file</I>.
It can be, for example, a program in /bin or /usr/bin not modifiable by users.
<P>
If there are three fields (i.e. two colon characters), it means that the user wants the
cryptographic digest check on the executable file integrity.
When a user edits their scado file, if the field (<I>sha256_digest_of_the_executable</I>) is empty, <B>scado</B> 
computes it automatically when the scado file is saved.
<P>
<B>Scado</B> asks for user authentication by PAM to confirm any modification of the scado file.
<P>
There is also a <I>TOCTTOU</I> protection at running time: cado -S copies the executable file 
in a safe place, where the user cannot change it, and runs it only if the integrity check on it succeeds.
The user (or a malicious intruder acting as the user) cannot modify the file after the integrity check has completed
and before the program is loaded.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<I>scado</I>

accepts the following options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-l<DD>

--list
Display the current scado file. The actual file in the file system is not accessible by unprivileged users, for security reasons.
<DT>-e<DD>

--edit
Edit the scado file of the current user using the editor specified by either the
VISUAL</B> or the <B>EDITOR</B> environment variable (checked in that order).
After you exit from the editor, the modified file will be installed automatically.
<DT><B>-D<DD>

--delete
Delete the current user's scado file.
<DT>-u</B> <I>command</I><DD>

<B>--update</B> <I>command</I>
Recompute the hash of the line which starts with <I>command</I>.
<DT><B>-U<DD>

--update-all
Update all the digest entries.
<DT>-h<DD>

--help
print a short usage banner and exit.
<P>
</DL>
</B><A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXCEPTIONS FILES EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>
<P>

Allow <B>cado -S</B> to run /bin/ping providing it with the cap_net_raw capability, without any integrity check: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
/bin/ping : cap_net_raw
</DL>

<P>
<P>

Allow the activation of ping with cap_net_raw provided it has a specific SHA256 digest
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
/bin/ping : cap_net_raw : dcb237f1cb20ee7b1550900d1b524c554063fd17fc673c56d341736ced6bed4b
</DL>

<P>
<P>

Compute the SHA256 digest of (the current version of) ping so,
allow the activation of ping with cap_net_raw provided it has not been modified.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
/bin/ping : cap_net_raw :
</DL>

<P>
<P>

If one of the example lines here above has been inserted in the user scado file using
<B>scado -e</B>, it is possible to execute ping as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
cado -S cap_net_raw /bin/ping
</DL>
